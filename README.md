# Hospital-Simulation

Small project written in C and using threads that simulates a given amount of patients viziting a hospital with 5 doctors for a consultation. The times between arriving patients and the consultation durations are random, and for each patient there is a thread created. The program also tracks how much has a patient waited for a consultation and it's duration, as well as how many patients had each doctor.
